# How Blind People Read PDF Documents

## Assistive Technology Used to Read PDFs

Blind and visually impaired individuals utilize a variety of assistive technologies to read PDF documents [8, 6]. These include screen readers which convert on-screen text into speech or braille output [8, 12], screen magnifiers [6], text-to-speech software [6], speech recognition software [6], and alternative input devices [6]. Some specific examples of screen readers include JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA, Orca, and System Access [8].  There are also apps like Voice Dream Reader and Claro PDF that can convert inaccessible PDFs into accessible formats [9].

## The Importance of Accessible PDFs

A standard PDF is not inherently readable by assistive technologies [7, 10]. PDFs must be "accessible" to be readable, meaning they must meet accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.0 [10]. This includes proper tagging of elements like headings, lists, and data tables [10]. Accessible PDFs allow screen readers to interpret the document's structure and content correctly [6, 7, 10]. Scanned documents or images within PDFs are typically inaccessible because screen readers cannot read the text within images [7, 9].

## Converting Inaccessible PDFs

Several methods can convert inaccessible PDFs into accessible formats [7, 9]. Apps like Voice Dream Scanner and Claro PDF can convert scanned documents or images into readable text [9]. ABBYY FineReader PDF also assists by converting PDFs into a machine-readable format utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [12]. These tools allow screen readers to interpret the content and present it to the user [9, 12].

## Key Features of Accessible PDFs

Accessible PDFs rely on features such as proper tagging to define the document's structure [10]. These tags communicate the content and organization to assistive technologies [10].  Headings should be tagged using paragraph styles, and lists should be automatically tagged [10]. Data tables should have column headers to improve understanding [10]. Proper tagging ensures the document can be navigated and interpreted effectively by screen readers [10].

## PDF Creation & Accessibility Tools

Software such as Adobe Acrobat Pro is needed to construct and verify accessible PDFs [10]. ABBYY FineReader PDF aids in converting documents and ensuring they are accessible via text-to-speech and other assistive technologies [12]. Additionally, some tools can export documents to PDF/UA format, which supports accessibility features [12].
