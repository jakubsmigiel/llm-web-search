# State of the Art Espresso Methodology

## Coffee Bean Quality & Freshness
Using fresh, specialty coffee beans is crucial [6, 9]. Beans should be consumed within three to four weeks of roasting [6]. Medium-light roast profiles are recommended [9].

## Grind Size
The coffee beans should be ground to resemble fine sugar or table salt [6, 9]. Adjusting the grind size is essential for controlling extraction – finer for slower extraction, and coarser for faster [12]. 

## Coffee Dose
The optimal amount of coffee for a single espresso is 7g, while a double shot recipe aims for 18g of ground coffee [6, 9].

## Tamping
Ground coffee beans should be tamped with approximately 15kg of pressure, and it's important to maintain consistency [6, 9]. Even compression of the grounds is key [9].

## Water Quality & Temperature
Filtered, low-mineralized water with an acidity level of approximately 7 pH is recommended [6]. The water temperature should be around 94-96°C [6]. 

## Extraction Time & Ratio
Aim for a 1:2 coffee-to-espresso ratio (e.g., 18g of coffee to 36g of espresso) [9]. The ideal extraction time generally falls between 27-35 seconds for a double shot [9, 12]. Monitoring the extraction time, starting between 6-10 seconds after the brew cycle begins, is important [9].

## Assessing Extraction Quality
A good extraction is indicated by a "mouse tail" pour, a thick, dark golden crema (3-5mm), and a firm, dry puck [12]. Aiming to end the shot when the color lightens to a tan or "blonde" indicates correct extraction, meaning about 20% of the coffee’s weight has dissolved [2].

### Adjusting for Extraction Issues
If the espresso is sour, discard the first one or two seconds of the flow [2]. If it tastes flat or bitter, stop the extraction at a darker color to increase the proportion of sugars and caramels [2]. Adjustments may also be needed due to weather (humidity), bean age (de-gassing), or changes in coffee blends [12].

## Equipment
Investing in a decent coffee machine capable of reaching 9 bars of pressure and controlling extraction time is important [6, 9].

## Espresso Machine Types
Espresso machines are categorized into super-automatic, semi-automatic, and manual types based on automation levels [30]. Super-automatic machines are user-friendly with built-in grinders, requiring minimal effort. Semi-automatic machines require manual grinding, tamping, and milk steaming, offering more control and customization. Manual machines use a lever to create pressure, known for producing thick crema and rich espresso [30].

### Considerations for Machine Selection
When choosing an espresso machine, consider budget, boiler type (single boiler, dual boiler, heat exchanger), milk steaming capabilities, reservoir capacity, temperature control (PID), portafilter size, ease of use, durability, grind quality, water filtration, and programmability [30].

## Grinder Types
Burr grinders produce a more consistent grind size compared to blade grinders [26, 30]. Conical burr grinders are generally quieter and produce less heat than flat burr grinders [26, 30]. Flat burr grinders are often faster and more efficient than conical burr grinders [26, 30]. All-in-one coffee machines combine a brewing machine and a coffee grinder [30].

## Coffee Bean Temperature and Grind Temperature
Grinding coffee at higher temperatures accelerates extraction [53], potentially leading to a faster shot time but also overextraction and bitterness. It’s recommended to adjust grind size and extraction time to compensate and cool the grounds promptly after grinding [53]. Higher temperatures enhance aroma, but excessive heat can degrade flavors and cause defects [53]. Maintaining a low temperature of the beans before grinding is key [53]. 
Grinding at lower temperatures slows extraction, preserving delicate flavors and minimizing heat-related defects [53]. Adjustments to grind size and extraction time are needed to compensate [53].
