# Pressure Achievable with Silicone Seals in High-Vacuum Systems & 3D Printing Considerations

## Achievable Pressure Ranges

Silicone seals in high-vacuum systems can achieve varying pressure limits depending on the specific material and application. Several sources indicate different achievable pressures. Some sources specify pressures in Torr, while others use Pa or mbaar. 

One source states that systems using Vacseal silicone resin can reach ultimate pressures of 1 x 10-12 Torr [5, 16]. Another source indicates a pressure limit of 30 Pa with silicone seals, accompanied by a temperature range of -271 °C to 500 °C [13]. Multiple sources specify a pressure of 1x10-3 Torr as achievable with various silicone gasket makers and sealants [9, 21]. One source details high-vacuum silicone grease being suitable for systems up to 10-6 mbaar [19]. Additionally, Hysol® Low Vapor-pressure Epoxy Resin Sealant can be used at pressures of 10-9 or below [11]. 

### Contradictions and Variations

There's significant variation in the reported achievable pressures. While some sources claim pressures as low as 1 x 10-12 Torr [5, 16], others report significantly higher limits like 1x10-3 Torr [9, 21] or 30 Pa [13]. This suggests that the type of silicone material, the specific application, and the overall system design all play crucial roles in determining the ultimate achievable pressure. 

## Leak Rates and Related Measurements

Besides pressure, some sources describe performance in terms of leak rates. Vacseal can seal leaks as large as 4-micron liters per second [5, 16], and one source details a leak rate of 1.6 x 10-8 grams/cm7hr [16]. These measurements provide an alternative way to quantify the effectiveness of silicone seals in maintaining vacuum integrity.

## Material Specifications & Applications

The type of silicone material is crucial to performance. Several sources highlight specific products: Vacseal silicone resin [5, 16], Permatex silicone gasket makers [9, 21], and high-vacuum silicone grease [19]. The range of applications includes vacuum pumps [9, 21], vacuum systems, accelerator facilities, and space engineering [13].  Other highlighted products include Tek-Seal [8], Celvaseal [11], and Sigma-Aldrich silicone grease [25], with applications extending to mould sealing [27].



## 3D Printing Considerations

The compatibility of 3D printed devices in cleanroom environments is important for semiconductor processing. One source [17] specifies that 3D-printed devices can be used in cleanroom environments if they meet specific standards. Several sources emphasize the need for compatibility in applications such as semiconductor processing [17, 18]. 

### Material Considerations for 3D Printing

Material selection is crucial to maintaining the integrity of vacuum systems. Some sources specify that certain materials are better suited for high-vacuum applications than others. It is noted that 3D-printed materials must be compatible with the desired vacuum level [17].

### Outgassing and Vapor Pressure

Outgassing from materials used in vacuum systems is a significant concern. Sources state that materials should have low outgassing rates to maintain the integrity of the vacuum [14, 15]. Materials with high vapor pressure are not ideal for use in high-vacuum environments [14].

## Silicone Material Characteristics 

Silicone-based materials exhibit characteristics crucial for vacuum applications, including low permeability and high resistance to chemicals. One source [26] highlights these traits, indicating silicone's effectiveness in preventing contamination and maintaining vacuum integrity.
