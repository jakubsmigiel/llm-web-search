# Distance from the Earth to the Sun

## Average Distance

The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) [7, 8]. This distance is also defined as one Astronomical Unit (AU) [6, 7].  Another source states the distance is approximately 149.6 million km (about 92.96 million miles) [6].

## Using Astronomical Units

The AU remains the baseline for measuring distances within the Milky Way [5]. It’s also used to calibrate distances to objects outside the Milky Way using parallax [5].

## Consistency of Distance

Earth’s orbit around the Sun is nearly circular, meaning the distance doesn’t vary significantly throughout the year [6].
